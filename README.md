# Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the stock prices of Apple Inc. (AAPL) using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network capable of learning order dependence in sequence prediction problems. This README provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, and how to use the project.

## Installation
To run this project, you need Python and several Python packages related to data science and machine learning.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or above
- pip (Python package installer)

### Dependencies
Install the following Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Follow these steps to run the stock price prediction model:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jaywyawhare/stock-price-prediction-lstm.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:

    ```bash
    cd stock-price-prediction-lstm
    ```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

4. Open the `lstm.ipynb` notebook and run the cells to train the LSTM model and predict the stock prices.
